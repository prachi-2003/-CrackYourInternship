### Day 1
- Question 1: Merge Sorted Arrays (https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/description/) - key point : put the largest element at the end.
- Question 2: Two Sum (https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/) - key point: use unordered_map for optimised solution (map element with its index if no complementary element present in array else return the pair).
- Question 3: Remove duplicate from sorted array (https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/) - key point: two pointer approach- keep a pointer for tracking index where we need to put the unique element and second pointer to find unique element. We do so by comparing current element with previous element in the array.
